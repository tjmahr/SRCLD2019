Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------

> **Intelligibility in multiword utterances in children with cerebral
> palsy**
> 
> Children with cerebral palsy (CP) commonly have speech-motor disorder
> (dysarthria). Intelligibility measures the degree to which a listener
> can recover a speaker’s intended message, so it provides a measure of
> how functional a child’s speech is for communication. We examined
> growth in intelligibility in multiword utterances for 65 children with
> CP from age 2 to age 8. We also compared how developmental
> trajectories differed across three speech-language profile groups: no
> speech-motor impairment, speech-motor impairment with typical language
> comprehension, and speech-motor impairment with impaired language
> comprehension. Children with CP showed highly variable growth
> patterns, but speech-language profiles captured some developmental
> similarities. Children without dysarthria reached a higher estimated
> intelligibility and showed their window of fastest growth a year
> earlier than their peers with dysarthria. Children with dysarthria and
> language impairment had noisier measurements and probably had lower
> intelligibility attainments than their peers with typical
> comprehension. Implications for assessment and treatment planning are
> discussed. Research supported by NIDCD R01 DC009411 and NICHD U54
