# Notes on poster formats

Create the poster-size PDF:

* `Export > Create PDF/XPS Document`
* Choose `Optimize for: Standard (publish online and printing)`
* Go to options and uncheck `ISO 19005-1 compliant (PDF/A)`. Otherwise, the UW logo is ruined.

Do not use Save as Adobe PDF because that compresses images and adds JPEG artifacts to figures.

**The PDF here is the proof provided by the printer. not these steps above.** This version uses a different UW Logo image than the PowerPoint file.

Create the letter-size PDF:

* Use some equivalent of printing to a PDF file.

Create the poster-size PNG:

* `Save As` a PNG.
* Compress with https://tinypng.com/

Create the thumbnail-size PNG:

* `Save As` a PNG.
* Use Paint to resize to 800 pixels wide.
* Compress with https://tinypng.com/
